This program simply creates some graphs in html using svg elements. All graphs (minus the pie chart) are based around the points 200, 150, 250, 100, 100, 175, 175, 300. The first two graphs are bar graphs just with different colors. The next two are line graphs, one line the other dashes. The final one is a pie chart, with a 90 degree blue wedge sectioned out from the rest of the cyan circle.
There are no parameters, so you can just open the index.html in your browser. I used Microsoft Edge.


## Included files

README.md -- this file
