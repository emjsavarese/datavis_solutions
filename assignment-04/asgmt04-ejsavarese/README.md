## Notes
This program will recreate 4 visualizations: The first three are based off of ukDriverFatalities.js: where it displays different ways to show the information. The first visualization seperates each column based on year, every rectangle within that column based on month, and how deep the blue is indicates how many fatalities there were. The second is the same as the previous one, only using circles and the radius indicates the number of fatalities. The third graph is similar to the previous two, but the height of the rectangles determines how many fatalities happened per month. The final graph is based on the calvinScores.js, with the GPA as the x value, the y value is the ACT score, the radius is based on the SATV, and the color is based on the SATM score. 
This was run on a windows machine!
