## Notes

The last chart isnt done but I may not go back to fix it.

The magnitude for the final item is for some reason not working? I've run it through the console
and it appears to be setting the color correctly, it just all looks the same on my computer? Which
I don't understand why and I was too mad about this that I will just return to doing jitter 
later.
