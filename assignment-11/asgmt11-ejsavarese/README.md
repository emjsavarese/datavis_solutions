## Notes

This isn't complete as of right now. But it does put the points on the graph and the points. It can sometimes be laggy but Idk if thats my browser or my half completed code.
But this should create a svg of points, a color bar, and a few buttons. Clicking the buttons changes the color map of the item. 


## Included files

* a11.js - A js file that visualizes the vti files, allowing a user to spin and interact
            with the visuals, as well as use the points to change the opacity. 
* d3.js - A library used to aid in creating visualizations!
* volren.js - I also have no idea what this file does.
* vtk.js - I have no idea what this file does.
* README.md - Its this file!
* index.html - The basic html file with a couple of divs and buttons.
* datasets - a folder containing .vti files
