## Notes
    This program takes an array of objects that represent a treemap and draws them onto the screen,
    deciding how specifically to draw them based on a specific button press. 
    size - rectangles are proportional to their size stat. Cuts horizontal/vertical determined by depth.
    best size - same as size, but cuts horizontally/vertically depending on the height/width of the rectangle (depth if even.)
    count - rectangles are equal in size to other rectangles in their subtree. Cuts horizontal/vertical determined by depth. 
    best count - same as count, but cuts horizontally/vertically depending on the height/width of the rectangle (depth if even.)
